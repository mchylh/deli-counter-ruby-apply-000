# 2 Build a method that a new customer will use when entering the deli.
# The `take_a_number` method should accept two arguments, the array for
# the current line of people (`katz_deli`), and a string containing the
# name of the person wishing to join the line.
# The method should return the person's name along with their position in line.
#**Top-Tip:** *Remember that people like to count from* `1`*, not from* `0` *("zero")
#like computers.*

def take_a_number(katz_deli, name)
  katz_deli.push(name)
# use the push method for Append â€” Pushes the given object(s) on to the end of this array. This expression returns the array itself, so several appends may be chained together.
  puts "Welcome, #{name}. You are number #{katz_deli.length} in line."
# return the person's name along with their position in line by using the hashtag, swingly brackets to call every arguement's iteration
end

# Build the `now_serving` method which should call out (i.e. `puts`)
# the next person in line and then remove them from the front.
# If there is nobody in line, it should call out (`puts`) that
# `"There is nobody waiting to be served!"`.
# can use a boolean to see the array is empty or not, if true then return the string "There is nobody waiting to be served!"
# if false, then return "Currently, serving xyz person" - should use a #{} within the string to return the arugment
def now_serving(nextperson)
  if nextperson.empty?
    puts "There is nobody waiting to be served!"
  else
    puts "Currently serving #{nextperson[0]}."
    nextperson.shift
    # as people leave the line, then the method will need to move to the next person, so use shift to removes the first element of the nextinline array and returns it (shifting all other elements down by one). Returns nil if the array is empty.
